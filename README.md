# The Mentarian Online
## About
The Mentarian is the official campus publication of MISJ. With a keen journalistic eye, this student-run paper navigates the currents of academia, sports, arts, and beyond, offering insightful commentary, breaking news, and in-depth features that inform, inspire, and ignite conversations among students, staff, and parents alike.

This project is an initiative to effectively store, organize, and digitally distribute our (sometimes) monthly publications to our students, and the general public.
