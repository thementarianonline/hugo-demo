As the results show, MISJ is the MISCUP 2023 champion. The victory is most dedicated to all students who participated in the competition because every single match matters. This MISCUP is also a victory for the Student Council as the council has finally succeeded in fulfilling a campaign promise that has long eluded many Student Councils in the past. As the first Council to organize MISCUP, they have set a blueprint for the next Student Council to come.
