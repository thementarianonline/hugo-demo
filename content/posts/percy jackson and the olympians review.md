After 19 years, two not-so-quite faithful movies, and an unauthorized stage show, Percy Jackson and the Olympians is finally getting a long-awaited faithful adaptation in the form of a TV show. 

Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a masterpiece that perfectly intertwines the stories of Greek mythology in the modern world, giving it a new twist, filled with witty humor and its own signature style.

The new Percy Jackson isn’t a copy-paste adaptation. Things inevitably diverge from the source material, it has to. But it was clear that the creators put extra care into making sure that the heart of the books would still be present in these changes. 

The pacing wasn’t perfect, with some things having to be cut out to fit the run time of the show. Every fight scene is so perfectly choreographed and performed, with epic sword fights and monster attacks. Likewise, its monsters are nothing short of exceptional, too. The production team pulled off a great job to bring this mythical world to life. The series is a perfect balance of two halves, where while being able to keep the audience gripping in their seats in its action scenes, it still has emotional scenes that tug on their heartstrings.

The casting is spot on, too - with Leah Sava Jeffries perfectly encapsulating Annabeth Chase’s brains and wittiness, and Aryan Simhadri with Grover Underwood’s sympathy and care. But shining above all, Walker Scobell, the star of the show, surpassed everybody’s expectations on the silver screen as he not only did masterfully play the role of Percy, he lived the part. 

By far, the new Percy Jackson is one of the best book-to-screen adaptations anyone could ever get. Percy Jackson is nothing but a timeless classic that will forever hold its mark in the world and everybody’s hearts.

The series was set for its premiere on the 20th of December on the Disney+ streaming service with a runtime of 8 episodes. On the 8th of February, it was announced that the show had been renewed by Disney+ for a second season, following the second book.

Hold fast, demigods! The sea is deeper than you think.
